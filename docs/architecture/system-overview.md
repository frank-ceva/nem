# System Architecture Overview

This folder describes how the language and toolchain operate technically.

## Components

- Language Spec
- Interpreter
- Compiler
- Binder
- Simulator

## Interaction Model

- Spec defines semantics.
- Compiler lowers source to IR and object format.
- Binder encodes instructions.
- Simulator executes encoded program.
- Interpreter provides reference execution path.

Detailed architectural documents should be added here over time.
