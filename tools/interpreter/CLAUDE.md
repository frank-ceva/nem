## Role

The interpreter is the **reference implementation of language semantics**.
Correctness and clarity take precedence over performance.

You MAY modify code under `tools/interpreter/**` ONLY.

You MUST comply with guidelines defined in @work_instructions.md and @tools/tools_instructions.md and also enforce engineering process defined in the the engineering directory, using @docs/engineering/README.md as an entry point.
