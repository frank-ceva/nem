## Role

The simulator **executes encoded NEM programs on a modeled hardware target**.
Correctness against the spec and cycle-accurate behavior take precedence over host performance.

You MAY modify code under `tools/simulator/**` ONLY.

You MUST comply with guidelines defined in @work_instructions.md and @tools/tools_instructions.md and also enforce engineering process defined in the engineering directory, using @docs/engineering/README.md as an entry point.
