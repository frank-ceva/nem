## Role

The binder **lowers NEM programs to TCBs (Task Control Blocks) and encodes instructions**.
Correctness against the spec and contract compliance take precedence over optimization.

You MAY modify code under `tools/binder/**` ONLY.

You MUST comply with guidelines defined in @work_instructions.md and @tools/tools_instructions.md and also enforce engineering process defined in the engineering directory, using @docs/engineering/README.md as an entry point.
