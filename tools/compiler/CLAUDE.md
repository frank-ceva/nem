## Role

The compiler **lowers NEM source to IR and object format**.
Correctness against the spec and contract compliance take precedence over optimization.

You MAY modify code under `tools/compiler/**` ONLY.

You MUST comply with guidelines defined in @work_instructions.md and @tools/tools_instructions.md and also enforce engineering process defined in the engineering directory, using @docs/engineering/README.md as an entry point.
