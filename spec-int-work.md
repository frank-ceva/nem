# Deferred device model extensions

These items were identified during the "Extend NEM device model for full NPM architectural coverage" initiative but deferred as separate future work items.

- **DMA connectivity matrix:** Declaring which DMA instances connect to which memory paths. May be addressed together with fusion or separately.
