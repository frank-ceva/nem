# Common infrastructure
Before proceeding with the development of the NEM tools, we need to define the common infrastrcture that will be shared by all these tools, and develop it before we start working on the tools so that we avoid code duplication and redundancy.
Analyze the intent of the tools, and suggest what should be common across 2 or more of them.
